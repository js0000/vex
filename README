# vex

# vex is a way to generate arbitrary length realizations of erik satie's
# _vexations_ as midi files


PREREQUISITES
=============

web server that can run perl CGI scripts

perl libraries
---- ---------
CGI
Text::Template
MIDI::Simple
IO::File


HOW TO SET UP
=== == === ==

use or create a directory on the webserver where perl scripts can run under
CGI. it is well beyond my patience to try and explain this too you. RTFM.

put script [.pl] and template [.html] in the same CGI directory [as above].

navigate to script and enjoy.

i put limits on how long a particular realization can be, but i would expect
you can change them by editing vex.pl lines 50-57.


A BIT ABOUT SATIE
= === ===== =====

vexations was pretty much unknown until cage rediscovered in the 1960s. satie
appeals to me for many reasons, one of which is that he never took himself too
seriously. another is that i think his music offers a gateway into deeper
truths than sounds in time. but i fear that is it a matter that i will not be
able to convince any to change their minds about, as it is almost wholly in the
realm of the intangible things that influence our lives.
